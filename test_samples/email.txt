Subject: Project Documentation

Hi Team,

I am attaching the document we discussed. It contains the technical specifications for the API build, but it also includes the liability clauses and the final billing schedule.

Is this considered the main contract or just the invoice attachment? It seems to be a mix of all three.

Please review.
